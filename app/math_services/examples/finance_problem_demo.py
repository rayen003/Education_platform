Your answer was $155,340, while the correct answer is $147,470. The difference is in how the present values were calculated or summed. The correct calculation involves:

1. Finding the present value of each year's cash flow
2. Adding all present values to get $647,469.61
3. Subtracting the initial investment of $500,000 to get $147,469.61
4. Rounding to the nearest dollar gives $147,470
