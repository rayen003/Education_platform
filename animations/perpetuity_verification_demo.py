[3.0s] Perpetuity is a fundamental concept in finance, representing an infinite stream of equal payments.

[8.5s] We calculate the present value of a perpetuity using a simple formula: PV equals C divided by r,
where C is the periodic payment amount and r is the interest rate.

[15.2s] Let's look at our example: A company promises to pay $5,000 annually forever, with an interest rate of 5%.
What is this perpetuity worth today?

[20.5s] Using our formula, we divide the $5,000 payment by the 0.05 interest rate.
This gives us a present value of $100,000.

[25.0s] On our timeline, we can visualize how $5,000 is paid each year, continuing infinitely.
Each green arrow represents a $5,000 payment.

[32.0s] The key insight is that $100,000 invested at 5% generates exactly $5,000 in interest annually.
This allows the $5,000 withdrawal each year without ever depleting the principal.

[38.5s] So remember, for any perpetuity, the present value is simply the payment divided by the interest rate.
In our example: $100,000 = $5,000 ÷ 0.05.
